View the [package site](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/docs/flexample).

## Installation

You can install the released version of flexample from [TRAN](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/home/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flexample", repos = "http://shiny.technomics.net/tran")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix, or to use a feature from the development version, you can install flexample from GitLab using [`rnomics`](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/docs/rnomics/).

```{r eval=FALSE}
rnomics::gitlab_install("costverse/flexample", branch = "master")
```

### Clone Repository

Clone the repository into a working directory of your choice. Use either the RStudio menus or [`rnomics`](http://shiny.technomics.net/tran/www/docs/rnomics/).

```{r eval=FALSE}
rnomics::gitlab_clone("costverse/flexample", "your/file/directory/here")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(flexample)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitLab!
